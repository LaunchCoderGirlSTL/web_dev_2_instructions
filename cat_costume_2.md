# Cat Costume Project - Responsive

### Intro
Now you are going to work on making the Cat Project Responsive.

You will do this by, taking one level of the Journey into Mobile course (on CodeSchool) and then applying that level to your Cat Project.

Before you start make sure you have used git and committed the latest version of your Cat Project. You want to maintain the desktop state in case things get screwed up here.


#### Challenge 1: Take Level One.

#### Challenge 6: Make Your Site Adaptive


#### Challenge 7: Take Level Four


#### Challenge 8: Take Level 5


#### Challenge 9: Media Queries??



**STEP 1: Initialize Git Repo**  
Open your terminal (if not already open) and navigate to your `cat_costume_project` directory.

Make sure you are inside your project directory so `cd cat_costume_project` and when you `ls` you see the index.html file.

Use the `git init` command to initialize this project as a git repository.

Then configure your git name and email with the following commands.

```
git config --global user.name <name>
git config --global user.email <email>
```


> Initializing the directory as a git repository, allows you to use git version control on this project.

**STEP 2: Making Your First Commit**  
Use the following commands to make your first initial commit...

```
git add .
git commit -m "created project structure"
```

That's it! Now you are ready to code!

#### Challenge 3: Start Working on the HTML/CSS

Take a look at the design files for this project (located in the design folder). Pick a piece to work on and go from there. Remember to use git along the way to keep track of changes. Below is a cheat sheet to help you:

```
// what changes have been made from my previous version
git status

// stage these changes, they are pretty good and I will probably want to commit them
git add <file-path>

// commit all my staged changes because I am done with a little piece
git commit -m “this is what i changed”

// list all of my commits
git log

// undo this file change because I messed up and don't want it anymore
git checkout <file>

```
